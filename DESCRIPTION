Description: rpubprofile uses the Scopus API to fetch publication and citation data 
    based on a researcher's Scopus ID, and creates two plots that summarise a researcher's 
    publishing history in terms of number of publications over time, citations received and 
    most common subject areas. It requires a subscription to Scopus (authentication is 
    IP-based) and the passing of valid Scopus API key to the data fetching function.
